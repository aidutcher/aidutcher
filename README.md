## Hail and well-met, friend! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile!  Feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-dutcher-650b36124/) as well, or my [blog](https://dev.to/aidutcher) on dev.to where I post notes and study materials related to what I'm learning.

My main interests are analytics engineering and data engineering.  You'll find repositories here related to those topics as well as the occasional goofy side project, like auto-random-pointilism, which just makes random asbtract images in MS Paint.  

My hobby work involves database development, ETL, and cloud data warehousing.
